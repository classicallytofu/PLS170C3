                <p>Sustainability may sound like a buzzword but what does it really mean and what does it look like in the city of Tucson, Arizona? Sustainability, unlike what most people think, is not limited to the environment, though that is a large part of it. It also (shouldn’t) mean that we compromise the present economy for the environment's future. Rightly defined, sustainability is meeting the needs of the present without compromising the needs of the future. You might say that sounds broad, and it is, intentionally, so that we don’t neglect one aspect for another, like if a sustainable solution costs too much, that would neglect the costs of that solution. This is a good moment to mention the three pillars of sustainability: Environment, Economy, and Society. For a solution to be sustainable it must address each of these pillars. In this article, we’ll take a look at how the UofA is addressing sustainability through the ENR2 building. Examining the three pillars, we’ll consider how the ENR2 building is attempting to mitigate and adapt to climate change, reduce the cost of energy/of the building itself, and incorporate human connection.</p>

    <p>The UofA is taking strides in sustainability and mitigating climate change with the ENR2 building. This building started in 2012 and opened in 2016 and now has a platinum LEED certification, the highest level of certification. According to the U.S. Green Building Council: “LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) is the most widely used green building rating system in the world.” The LEED certification measures how environmentally friendly a building is. Tucson has had to address the ever-changing climate, uniquely, being a drought-prone region. This adaptation to climate change has manifested itself in water reclamation and other water-conserving solutions. Naturally then, the ENR2 building reclaims rainwater to water plants in the center courtyard.</p>

    <p>The design of the ENR2 Building also aims to reduce its overall cost. Motion-sensing lights are installed in each room to conserve power. Along the same line, the intentional prominence of a central staircase not only encourages healthy living but also cuts down on elevator energy costs. To reduce maintenance costs, specifically, the aesthetic choice was made to not paint and leave most of the metal around the building untreated. This will eventually cause it to rust, leaving it a deep wildcat red. Thankfully, this is only a cosmetic change and not a structural one. Peter Dourlein, the UofA's assistant vice president of Planning, Design, and Construction had this to say about the cost of ENR2:</p>

    <p><em>“The building is not extravagant by any financial measure. There are simple materials, like concrete and steel, but they are used in such creative ways. The entire University and consultant team created a highly successful place that will efficiently and effectively serve and inspire the University for many years to come.”</em></p>

    <p>Additionally, the ENR2 has installed large outdoor fans that turn on based on the temperature. This is another cost-cutting measure.</p>

    <p>The ENR2 building has a strong social and human component too, as we have seen with the example of the staircase and the large outdoor fans. These fans, like the stairs, encourage healthy living by bringing the benefits of the outdoors without the added temperatures. However, there are even more social aspects to this building. ENR2 houses multiple departments such as part of Mathematics and Environmental Science to foster collaboration. This also demonstrates one of the UofA’s key goals, interdisciplinarity.</p>

    <p>With any solution, it’s important to weigh the advantages with the disadvantages in order to iterate on the solution. One disadvantage of addressing climate change with a building is that any building will have an impact on the environment no matter what. The architect of ENR2 has said that: <em>“The best building is the one that doesn’t get built at all.”</em> While I agree with the sentiment behind this—namely, that all buildings take a toll on the environment—I believe this is an unsustainable perspective. Why? Because it doesn’t consider that humans need buildings. This perspective doesn’t consider the urban planner’s perspective or the social pillar of sustainability.</p>

    <p>One other disadvantage concerns the use of automatic lighting. In an amusing and candid reflection, a tour guide at the ENR2 building expressed her annoyance with working in an office with motion-sensing lights because she would have to move occasionally to keep the lights on.</p>

    <p>This might lead you to wonder what’s next for the UofA and sustainability. What next step can we take toward reshaping our use of natural resources? Well, the ENR2 building is testing a new approach with Solar Panels. With the amount of sun we receive, Arizona has a special opportunity to use solar energy. However, Solar panels operate at specific temperatures—temperatures at about 90 degrees. Tucson, as we unfortunately know, regularly goes up and above 100 degrees. The solution being tested then, known as agrovoltaics, is to reduce the temperature of operating solar panels by growing plants beneath them. This not only has the potential for higher efficiency in energy production but it also provides a shady area to grow plants.</p>

    <p>The UofA is leading the way in sustainability with the ENR2 Building. We’ve seen how this building is sustainable by attempting to mitigate and adapt to climate change, reducing the cost of energy/of the building itself, and incorporating human connection. Each of these aspects of the ENR2 correlates with one of the three pillars of sustainability. Without consideration of the environment, this building could not sustain our world. Without consideration for the cost of this building, it could not be sustained by our budget. Without consideration for human design, this building could not sustain us. Without even one of these, the ENR2 building would not truly be sustainable.</p>
